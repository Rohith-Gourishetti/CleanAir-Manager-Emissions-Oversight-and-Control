                    Climate refers to the typical weather conditions in an area over a long period. 
                    <br>The climate should be stable,With moderate temperatures and balanced rainfall,Supporting diverse ecosystems and sustainable living,Minimizing extreme weather events ensures environmental stability and promotes planetary well-being. 
                    <br>It aims to reduce the frequency and intensity of natural disasters caused by climate-related phenomena.

                    Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The primary contributor to climate pollution is the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industrial processes.

                    <br>Industrial Activities: Industrial processes release pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution and climate change. Activities like manufacturing, mining, and agriculture release significant amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.

                    <br>Transportation: Vehicles, airplanes, and ships burn fossil fuels, emitting CO2 and other pollutants into the air. The transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, especially in urban areas with high traffic congestion.

                    <br>However, human activities like burning fossil fuels are causing the climate to change, leading to more extreme weather and harming the environment.

                <p>
                    Reduce fossil fuel dependency by investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.

                    <br>Implement cleaner production techniques and technologies to minimize emissions from industrial processes like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology and Switching to Cleaner Fuels(biofuels/natural gas instead of coal)technique.

                    <br>Promote the use of public transportation, carpooling, and biking to reduce emissions from transportation.

                    <br>Improve fuel efficiency standards for vehicles and invest in electric and hybrid vehicles.
